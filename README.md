Overview :

This C++ program is a simple multiple-choice quiz game. It asks the user three questions and checks if their answers are correct. It then calculates the user's score based on their responses and provides feedback based on the score.

Technologies Used:

C++ Programming Language: The program is written in C++, which is a widely used general-purpose programming language that is particularly known for its performance and efficiency.

Standard Input/Output: The program uses standard I/O functions like cin and cout to interact with the user. cin is used to take input from the user, while cout is used to display information to the user.


Objectives:

1. Interactive Quiz: The program provides an interactive quiz by asking three multiple-choice questions.


2. User Input Handling: It handles user input using cin and processes the user's responses.


3. Conditional Logic: It uses if statements to check the user's answers and increments the score for correct responses.


4. Feedback: Based on the final score, the program provides personalized feedback to the user.


5. Score Tracking: The program keeps track of the user's score throughout the quiz.


6. Basic Use of Control Flow: It demonstrates the use of if statements and basic control flow in C++.



Breakdown of the Code:

1. Score Initialization: The program starts by initializing a variable score to 0. This will be used to track how many correct answers the user gives.


2. Question 1:

The program presents the first question and multiple-choice answers.

It takes the user's answer as input using cin >> answer.

It checks if the answer is correct (in this case, 'b' or 'B') and increments the score if the answer is correct.



3. Question 2:

The second question follows the same pattern as the first. The answer is checked, and the score is updated accordingly.



4. Question 3:

The third question also follows the same pattern. After checking the answer, the score is updated if the answer is correct.



5. Final Score and Feedback:

After all three questions, the program displays the user's score (out of 3).

Depending on the score, it gives feedback:

3/3: Excellent!

2/3: Good job!

1/3: Not bad!

0/3: Better luck next time.





Sample Output:

Question 1: What is 2 + 2?
a) 3
b) 4
c) 5
d) 6
Your answer: b

Question 2: What is the capital of England?
a) Paris
b) London
c) Berlin
d) Madrid
Your answer: b

Question 3: Which planet is known as the Red Planet?
a) Earth
b) Mars
c) Jupiter
d) Saturn
Your answer: b

Your final score is: 3/3
Excellent! You got all the answers correct!

Conclusion:

This C++ program is a basic example of handling user input, conditional statements, and score tracking. It could be easily expanded with more questions or additional features such as time limits or difficulty levels. It demonstrates fundamental concepts in C++ such as user interaction, conditional logic, and loops (if needed).
